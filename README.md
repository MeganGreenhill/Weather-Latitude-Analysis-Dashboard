# Weather Latitude Analysis Dashboard

For this challenge, a visualization dashboard website was developed using visualizations created in a past assignment. This dashboard includes individual pages for each plot and a means by which users can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The dashboard also consists of a landing page, a page outlining a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where users can view the data used to build them. This website was then deployed to GitHub pages.

The website pages are as follows -
* A landing page, containing an explanation of the project and links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with a plot/visualization and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparisons page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page.
* A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
